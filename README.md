# crypto.bi CNT - Cardano Network Tools 

crypto.bi CNT implements some parts of the Cardano network protocol in Python.

Network analysis is crucial to running a high performance staking pool. This is true for any [PoS cryptocurrency](https://crypto.bi/tape/pos/).

These tools allow you to listen in on the Cardano network and process messages. 

You can think of CNT as a network node implementation without the block processing and verification components.
